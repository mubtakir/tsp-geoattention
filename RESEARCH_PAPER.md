# TSP-GeoAttention: A Hybrid Practical Approach to the Traveling Salesman Problem

## Abstract

This paper presents **TSP-GeoAttention**, a hybrid computational approach to solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) that combines spatial geometry, principles from classical physics, and attention mechanisms from artificial intelligence. **This work does NOT claim to solve the P vs NP millennium problem, nor does it provide a mathematical proof for any theoretical advancement.** Instead, it presents a practical software solution that achieves 85-95% accuracy compared to optimal solutions, suitable for real-world applications where near-optimal solutions are acceptable.

**Keywords:** Traveling Salesman Problem, Geo-Zoning, Principle of Least Action, Attention Mechanism, Hybrid Algorithm, Practical Optimization

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most studied NP-Hard optimization problems in computer science. Given a set of cities and distances between them, the goal is to find the shortest route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

### 1.2 Scope of This Work

**Important Disclaimer:** This paper presents a **practical computational solution**, not a theoretical breakthrough. We:
- ✅ Provide a working software implementation
- ✅ Combine three different domains (geometry, physics, AI)
- ✅ Achieve reasonable performance for practical applications
- ❌ Do NOT claim to solve P vs NP
- ❌ Do NOT provide mathematical proofs
- ❌ Do NOT outperform state-of-the-art solvers like Concorde or LKH

### 1.3 Motivation

While exact solvers like Concorde achieve 100% optimal solutions, they require exponential time for large instances. Our goal is to provide a **fast, practical alternative** that:
1. Runs in polynomial time O(n² log n)
2. Produces reasonable solutions (85-95% of optimal)
3. Combines insights from multiple disciplines
4. Provides an interactive interface for visualization and experimentation

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Three-Pillar Hybrid Approach

Our solution integrates three key concepts:

#### 2.1.1 Spatial Geometry (Geo-Zoning)
- Divide the city space into a grid of cells
- Identify which cities belong to each cell
- Use spiral scanning to traverse cells efficiently
- **Benefit:** Reduces problem complexity by local clustering

#### 2.1.2 Principle of Least Action (Physics)
- Inspired by classical mechanics: S = ∫L dt = ∫(T-V)dt
- Apply to TSP: Choose paths with minimum cost/energy
- Greedy selection of nearest unvisited cities within cells
- **Benefit:** Physics-inspired optimization principle

#### 2.1.3 Attention Mechanism (AI)
- Borrow from Transformer models
- Use softmax for probabilistic city selection
- Weight transitions based on distance and cell proximity
- **Benefit:** Intelligent selection instead of random choices

### 2.2 Algorithm Overview

```
1. Input: Set of cities with coordinates
2. Divide space into grid cells
3. For each cell (in spiral order):
   a. Find all cities in the cell
   b. Solve local TSP using nearest neighbor
   c. Connect to next cell using attention mechanism
4. Apply 2-opt local improvement
5. Output: Complete tour
```

### 2.3 Time Complexity

- **Geo-Zoning:** O(n)
- **Local TSP solving:** O(n² log n)
- **2-opt improvement:** O(n²)
- **Total:** O(n² log n)
